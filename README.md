# No Borders

No Borders is a traveling app designed to search nearly anywhere in the world and pull up interesting places to visit or popular places to eat. While anyone can search for locations, there are benefits to having an account. Upon creating an account, the user can save locations to their bucketlist and also take notes to remember details, phone numbers, hours, or anything else needed. Once visited, the user can click the completed button and the location will be pushed to their completed bucketlist so that the user can keep track of where they have been. No Borders can be used to create the user's dream vacation in one simple app.
